# ✅ Deployment Successful!

## 🎉 Your SPX Trading App is Now Live on Netlify!

### 🌐 Live URL:
**https://spx-trading-app.netlify.app**

---

## 🔧 What Was Fixed

### Problem:
The app was connecting to Capital.com API on localhost but failing on Netlify due to:
1. **Missing credentials** - localStorage credentials weren't available on deployed site
2. **CORS issues** - Browser security restrictions for cross-origin API calls

### Solution Implemented:

#### 1. **Netlify Functions (Serverless Functions)**
Created two secure backend functions:
- `capital-auth.ts` - Handles authentication with Capital.com API
- `capital-proxy.ts` - Proxies API requests (if needed)

#### 2. **Environment Variables**
Your Capital.com credentials are now securely stored in Netlify:
- ✅ `CAPITAL_API_KEY` = configured in Netlify environment variables
- ✅ `CAPITAL_IDENTIFIER` = configured in Netlify environment variables
- ✅ `CAPITAL_PASSWORD` = configured in Netlify environment variables

#### 3. **Smart Authentication**
The app now automatically detects where it's running:
- **Local (localhost)**: Uses localStorage credentials via Settings UI
- **Production (Netlify)**: Uses environment variables via Netlify Functions

## 🚀 How It Works Now

### On Netlify:
```
Browser → Netlify Function → Capital.com API
         (with env vars)      (authenticated)
```

### On Localhost:
```
Browser → Capital.com API
         (with localStorage credentials)
```
